#Oppression

A new strategy related gamemode

##About

This gamemode is all about rebellion and its cost and strategy. There are 2 teams fighting each other. The Resistance is fighting for rights and to be equal although how they achieve this may look heroic or may look dastardous and horrible. The Federal Agents have to stop anyone from joinning the Resistance without directly angering the civilans. There are 2 catches to the Feds. The Feds have to oppress the civilians without being noticed because the Feds are losing money rapidly without the Resistance interfering. The other catch is the there are limits to what the Feds can pay. If they start making money or more people end up fighting the Feds then they will be able to recruit more.

A round could last as long as 30 mintues with enough players

##At Start

* The Feds start with only a Leader at first but more people can join until the warning of too many people comes up.

* The Civilains are most of the population and will be civilans until they join the Feds or get seen doing Resistance actions or proclaim and openly confess being a Resistance Person. They also pay the most for Federal Failures

* The Resistance starts with no members. The first person to act as a Resistance person becomes the leader who must use startegy to figure out everything. The more players that join the easier it is to destroy the Feds. The thing is in order to play as a clear known Resistance is that you are a hunted person. If anyone sees you they are to report you and call for someone to kill you.


##How to Play

###Civilans
The Civilans are just suppose to decide who to join

###Federal Agents
The Feds need to disrupt the Resistance through missions and objectives or keep the Resistance away long enough to gain equipment and other stuff to win. When these objective complete, they gain points to win the round. If they convince civilans to join then they gain some points and gain another agent for the cause. The Feds need to keep from losing to much money or they lose anyway.

###Resistance Members
The Resistance Members have a similar goal as the Feds but directed at the Feds. They must also setup infiltration teams for the Feds. The Resitance can infiltrate and squash the Feds from the inside as well. They also gain points by taking objectives from the Feds.
